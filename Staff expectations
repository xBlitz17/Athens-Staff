__**Global Administrator**__

-Global Admins set the foundation of our staff team, if you’re looking to go above and beyond as a staff member make sure to get in contact with a Global Admin because they work very hard and will usually have something that you can help with. They are a last resort if you need help with something that the other ranks cannot answer, that being said is because they are generally very busy with trying to produce content for server updates. These are the people that the Admins will come to for help since they are the top of the food chain when it comes to staff!-

Administrator

-Admins are 1 step below global admins, they still are a high ranking staff member but are expected to produce more in-game when it comes to general staff duties. Admin is the rank that Global Mods should go to when it comes to asking for help, since Admins have proven themselves enough to move past the Global Mod rank. Admins are expected to help suggest/produce content, they are expected to be involved with any server update related situations, and they are definitely expected to put forth effort when it comes to beta testing!-

Global Moderator

-Global Mods are 1 step below Administrator. If a Global mod has a question they should ask an Admin before going to a Global Admin. Global Mods have proven themselves to move past the normal Mod rank and could be considered a senior moderator in other words. Global Mods are expected almost the same as Admins, they are expected to help produce content ideas for server updates, and also take part in beta testing. Although expectations are slightly less for Global Mods they are still expected to produce high quality ideas. Also they are expected to deal with much more in-game regards to helping new players/answering questions/and overall putting forth all their effort in to keep the community flowing.-

Moderator

-Moderator a mid-tier staff rank that is earned when Server Supports have proven themselves to move on, Moderator is 1 step below Global Mod. If a Mod has a question it should resort to a Global Mod before taking it one rank higher to admin and so on. Mods are expected to help loads server sided, they are required to hand out votes when votes aren’t working, they are to step in on any situation when it gets out of hand. Also they are expected to be role-models for the Server Supports and the community as a whole. Mods are expected to step in situations that get out of hand and when a Support cannot handle it. That being said they are expected to help with content ideas, and beta testing.-

Server Support

-Server Support is 1 step above Trial Support and 1 step below Mod. Server Support is usually held as a low-tier staff rank and is just a small window of what the staff team has to offer. Supports should go to Mods when they have questions before going ranks higher and asking. They are expected to keep the community fun and to get rid of all toxicity. They aren’t required as much to help with content suggestions but that’s not saying that they cannot. They are also required to help with beta testing. -

Trial Support

-Trial Support is the first rank given to a new staff member, generally means you have a limited time to prove yourself to move onto Server Support. It’s getting your foot in the door and to see what our staff team has to offer! Trial Supports are held to the same countability as regular Server Supports but they should go to a Server Support to ask questions before they go to ranks higher. We expect them to help out mostly server sided to help keep the community safe and fun for everyone, and once they progress higher in the rankings we will bring them into more content/suggestion settings. They are however expected to help with beta testing!-
